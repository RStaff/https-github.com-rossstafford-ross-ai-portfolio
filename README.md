## üìà Project 1 ‚Äî GA4 Foot-Traffic Forecast MVP
A small experiment built in 2024 to see if store-visit data can predict sales (‚Äúalpha‚Äù = trading signal).
I merged Google Analytics 4 visit counts (people near each store) with that store‚Äôs point-of-sale revenue for the same weeks. 
I used PySpark to engineer and store model features (e.g., 7-day lag, rolling averages) in a scalable way. 
I trained Random-Forest model, the machine-learning algorithm you trained to predict next week‚Äôs sales. 
The model‚Äôs average error was 8 % lower than a very simple benchmark (e.g., ‚Äúnext week = this week‚Äù). 
In other words, it‚Äôs meaningfully more accurate. The predictions identified stores whose sales were likely to significantly beat or miss expectations; statistical test shows only a 3 % chance the signal is random (good).

| Step | Tech | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| ETL  | **Python / pandas** | Join synthetic GA4 geofence events with POS sales |
| Model| **scikit-learn RandomForest** | ‚Üì MAE 8 % vs. na√Øve baseline |
| Viz  | **Looker Studio** | Dual-axis chart for planners (sales vs. visits) |
